SmallJavaMistake
================

How a small java mistake can be quite costly.

This is the code accompanying my blog post (http://liviutudor.com/2015/05/12/small-yet-so-costly-java-mistake/) about how a tiny mistake (in Java) can have rather drastic repercursions.

The code provided here is the actual *wrong* code (the one which causes the problem) and my blog posts walks you through it and what the issue is. If you want to have a go and figure out the issue yourself, have a look and see if you can spot it :) As a hint the problem is with [src/main/java/NamedThreadFactory.java] -- good luck with tracking it down :)
